## commentout.vim
This plugin enables us to comment out with "Ctrl-/" just like Atom.   

### Normal mode
- Type "Ctrl-/", we can comment(uncomment) out 1 row.
- Type "5"+"Ctrl-/", we can comment(uncomment) out 5 rows. 
So, please use like "dd"/"yy" command.

*If you choose multi rows, "uncomment" works only all rows commented out.*


### Visual mode
1. Type "v", enter Visual mode.
2. Select rows that you want to comment out.
3. Type "Ctrl-/".

*In visual mode, each row is judged either commentout or uncomment.**
